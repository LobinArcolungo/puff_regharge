# Puff Battery Cell Recharger
This progect aims to recharge lithium batteries from PUFF e-cigrettes and any other kind of disposable vapes.
No code is involved in the project but just a couple of .stl files and some photos to replicate what i did.

This kind of cells are rechargeable hundreds of times despite their limited capacity so they can be used for small electronic projects and for IoT devices.
With this device I hope to help other people find a way to easily recharge them.

## Components
- Old power bank to salvage the recharging chip from
